 *   - the encrypted document vault auto-unlocks with the demo master password
 *   - native save/open dialogs resolve to fixed paths under the app-data dir
 *
 * Gating: this is true ONLY when the bundle was explicitly built with the env
 * flag set. A normal `npm run build` / `tauri build` never sets it, so
 * production installers are unaffected. Every consumer must read DEMO_MODE
 * (not the env var directly) so the gate lives in exactly one place.

 * then fall back to the normal save-dialog flow.
